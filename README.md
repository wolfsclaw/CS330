<b>How do I approach designing software?</b><BR>
<BR>
<b>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?</b><BR>
<BR>
Using this program gave me another way that I can play with creating graphics and using the skills I learned in this class, I could have fun playing around with Visual Studio.<BR>
<BR>
<b>What design process did you follow for your project work?</b><BR>
<BR>
I used the picture that was given to me as a basic template, but I added my own flair into the scene.<BR>
<BR>
<b>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?</b><BR>
<BR>
Not sure if I will ever use OpenGL again.  If I do, I have the basic understanding to design a great 
art piece.<BR>
<BR>
<b>How do I approach developing programs?</b><BR>
<BR>
<b>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?</b><BR>
<BR>
I learned how to merge two shapes to make a complete object and how to size them.<BR>
<BR>
<b>How did iteration factor into your development?</b><BR>
<BR>
Many shapes I used the same dimensions with only adjusting them on the screen to make them off center.<BR>
<BR>
<b>How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?</b>
When I first started this code, I was completely lost on how it works, but with practice and the professor helping me with my questions, I was able to finally figure it out.<BR>
<BR>
<b>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?</b><BR>
<BR>
<b>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?</b><BR>
<BR>
This class helped me to better problem solve things when I'm stuck on somethings, which in computer science is a must.  You will come across lots of problems during the process of creating code and must be able to adapt to change.<BR>

<b>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?</b><BR>
<BR>
Learning to be able to problem solve is key to a successful career.  You are not going to have the answers to every problem and you sometimes need to make mistakes along the way to fix your mistakes and not let them happen again.
